The main task is to identify noise barriers in street view image by now, which is the binary classification. In future, we will involve the multi-class noise barriers  identification and some other interesting applications! The repo contains major sourse code of our project.

1. The current work is using ensemble model based on transfering thinking (some SOTA  pretrained models, such as ResNet and DenseNet) to identify noise barriers.
2. ...

> This repository is in updating. The part of data and model weights will upload into Baidu Cloud and Google Drive : )
